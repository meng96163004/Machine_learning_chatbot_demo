# Machine_learning_chatbot_demo

# Introduction
Machine learning in customer service is used to provide a higher level of convenience for customers and improve efficiency for support agents. Support focused tools enabled with machine learning are growing rapidly. The increasing ease-of-use has made several successful applications across a variety of industries. Gartner predicts that by 2021, 15 percent of customer service interactions will be handled completely by artificial intelligence (Bryan 2018). 

My aim in this project is to create an Intelligent Chatbot (a computer program that conducts a conversation) using machine learning, for customer service and accommodation retailers in the hospitality sector and charity sector. For example, fast food restaurant chains and charity shops. This project will use the fast food chain Subway as a case study and source of data. This project develops computer systems to provide intelligent decisions for businesses.
